# UAV

This UAV project was a my dream when I was student. There were countless failures to find drone materials. I remember printing parts one by one for a month with a free 3d printer at school in the heat of over 40 degrees. I made an airplane by learning 3D modeling myself, but I had no knowledge of airplane design, so I modeled the Spitfire from World War II.

I wrote a dozens of pages of project plans, but the drone I worked hard on eventually disappeared across the river due to a bug in my GPS code.

I'm a software engineer, but I was also very interested in this kind of hardware, but actually just making something is so much fun.
