# UAV

This UAV project has been a dream of mine since I was a student. I faced countless challenges, especially when it came to sourcing drone materials. I vividly remember spending a month, in over 40-degree heat, printing parts one by one using a free 3D printer at school. I taught myself 3D modeling to build an airplane, though I had no formal knowledge of aircraft design. As a result, I ended up modeling the iconic Spitfire from World War II.

I drafted dozens of pages of project plans, but despite my efforts, the drone I worked so hard on tragically vanished across the river due to a bug in my GPS code.

Although I'm primarily a software engineer, I’ve always had a strong interest in hardware projects like this. The process of creating something from scratch has always been a source of pure joy for me.
